Recursion :- When a function call itself util it met a specific Condition.

Three Essential Parts:

Base Case - Condition to stop recursion

Recursive Call - Function calling itself

Progress - Moving toward the base case

If conditon is NOT Specified  it will run Infinitly which will lead to Ran out of memory[Stack Overflow]

Breaking big problems into smaller ones - Like breaking a chocolate bar into pieces,
